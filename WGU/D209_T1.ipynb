    "\"The KNN algorithm operates on the principle of similarity or 'nearness,' predicting the label or value of a new data point by considering the labels or values of its K-nearest (the value of K is simply an integer) neighbors in the training dataset\" (Miesle, 2024). The dominant classes of the closest data points will suggest how a data point of interest should be classified. Overall, KNN is very simplicistic and has a fast training time. "
